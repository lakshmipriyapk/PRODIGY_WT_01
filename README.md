# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project features an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages. 

HTML is used to structure the menu.
CSS is used to style the menu.
JavaScript adds interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

Feel free to explore the code and see how the interactive elements work!
